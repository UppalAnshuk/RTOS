#<Server response times vs the no of clients requesting service>

Clients online | Server RT(nanosecs)
---------------|------------
5 |  20,000 - 90,000 (mean-50,000)
4 |  21,000 - 86,000 (mean - 61,000)
3 |  17,000 - 60,000 (mean - 38,000)
2 |  15,000 - 71,000 (mean - 34,000)
1 |  18,000 - 55,000 (mean - 27,000)

The results noticed here aren't very much upto expectations. There are quite some fluctuations which go against the theoretical
concepts but the mean RTs(response times) have been reduced rather smoothly which is consistent with the load.
