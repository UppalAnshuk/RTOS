# Server Response Times vs No. of clients requesting service

Clients online | Server RTs (nanosecs)
---------------|---------------
5 | 44,000 - 93,000 (mean - 78,000)
4 | 38,000 - 76,000 (mean 57,000)
3 | 21,000 - 61,000 (mean 54,000)
2 | 18,000 - 42,000 (mean 33,000)
1 | 11,000 - 27,000 (mean 19,000)

This table is more consistent with the load theory. Though during 3 clients the average time is still higher than one would expect it to be.
